I'm assuming that you are familiar with role playing games. Quill
won't explain much of what is common to most of them so If you are new
to roleplaying, I hope a little internet research will clear anything
up. If not please let me know either on Twitter (@jessebmiller),
through email <jesse@jessebmiller.com> or on the [Porcupine Studio
chat](chat.porcupine.studio) (Discord at the time of this writing).

Quill Adventure was influenced by a bunch of great prior work.

*Apocalypse World* by Meguey and D. Vincent Baker

*Blades in the Dark* by John Harper

*Ironsworn* by Shawn Tompkins

*Dungeons & Dragons* by Wizards of the Coast

*Path of Exile* by Grinding Gear Games

Thank you for the path you blazed!

The object of Quill adventure is to *become powerful* by the
*experience of dangerous adventure* but you might not because the
*danger is real* and *you could fucking die*.

* Design Goals

  - *It should be opinionated*. Strong choices for a focused audience
  - *Minimal quick math* Move calculations out of the flow of play and
    into character creation or session downtime
  - *Simple rule set* Minimal cross references and look ups,
    especially during the flow of play.
  - *Large design space* Support hacking and custom content.
  - *Efficient expert execution* Once a group masters the system, they
    all should easily maintain continuity and agreement about the
    whole of the fiction
  - *Enjoyable* Even groups that haven't yet mastered the system
    should none the less enjoy their time playing
    - specifically offering the pleasures of *discovery*, *emergent
      story*, *open worlds*, and *player challenge*
    - Player *agency* and *meaningful choice*
  - *Rules that drive the game* Rules should always drive the goals of
    the game, and may take players out of their characters to do so.
  - *Zine friendly* It should be a small core ruleset that fits in a
    small book. Expansions should fit in similarly small books.

* Safety

  At the beginning of every session, mention the X card, and ask if
  anyone has any lines or veils they want to have in place for the
  session. Something freeing and great happens when the game is safe
  and everyone knows what lines not to cross and trusts that everyone
  can speak up if something makes them uncomfortable trusting that the
  group will change it without judgment. Everyone can go a little
  deeper safe in the knowledge that if they go too far someone will
  speak up and everyone will step back and change it.

* Judgment calls

  When you play, youâ€™ll make several key judgment calls. Everyone
  contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for
  each:

  - Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? /Can this
    person be intimidated? Must we get out the thieves tools and/
    /tinker with this old rusty lock, or could it also be quietly
    finessed?/ The players have final say.
  - How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this
    circumstance? /How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very
    little or a whole lot?/ The GM has final say.
  - Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a
    given circumstance? /Does this fall from the roof break your leg?
    Do the constables merely become suspicious or do they already have/
    /you trapped?/ The GM has final say.
  - Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? /Is your
    character in position to make an action roll or must they first/
    /make a resistance roll to gain initiative?/ The GM has final say.

* The Basics

  These are the core rules that don't require a roll and that talents
  may depend on or affect.

** Rest

   There are *short rests* and *long rests*. Each require you to eat
   and drink. Short rests take about an hour. Long rests take at least
   8 hours.

** Injury and Death

   For every *injury* you suffer, mark one of the unmarked
   *injuries*. When all *injuries* are marked *face death*.

** Recovery

   After a *short rest* recover 1d6 *strain*

   After a *long rest* recover all *strain*.

   After a *long rest* if you have an *injury* to recover roll xd6
   where x is your number of *injuries*. If the highest die is 1-4
   recover one *injury*

   To recover from all your *injuries*, when you start to rest roll xd6
   where x is the number of *injuries* you have taken. Rest that many
   consecutive days to recover all your *injuries*. If someone is
   tending to you roll one fewer dice.

** Strain

   When *strain* is greater than 12 suffer 1d4 injuries and pass out
   for 20 minutes or until attended to for at least 1 minute. Upon
   waking you must immediately take a short rest (which means eat and
   drink) or pass out again.

*** Pushing

    You can push yourself on any check and take as many of the
    following as you want as many times as you want but declare it all
    and take the *strain* before you roll the check.

    - take 1d6 *strain* and gain advantage or lose disadvantage
      (take this twice to go from disadvantage to advantage)
    - take 1d4 *strain* and roll a d6 instead
    - take 1d6 *strain* and roll a d8 instead
    - take 1d8 *strain* and roll a d10 instead
    - take 1d10 *strain* and roll a d12 instead
    - take 1d4 *strain* and reduce the difficulty by 1
    - take 1d4 *strain* and increase your effective *potential* by 1
    - take 1d12 *strain* to get an automatic *hit*
    - take 1d10 *strain* to get an automatic *bust*

*** Resisting

    After you roll you can resist the consequence of a *bust* or a
    *miss* by paying *strain*. Narrate how you are avoiding it then roll
    to see how much *strain* you take to do it.

    take 1dx *strain* where x is the same die you rolled for a *miss*
    and one level lower for a *bust* to a minimum of 4.


* Creating Characters

  Distribute 2d10, 3d8, and 4d6 to any *talents* you'd like to start
  with. Only one die per talent. All PCs start with every *talent* at
  d4

  Take as much gear as you want but check with your GM and other
  players first to make sure everyone is happy with it.

  Complete the calculations on your chatacter sheet.

* The Talents

  It's a tabletop role playing game so once the group has read this
  through, followed the instructions, and made some characters (PCs),
  the game master (GM) will describe the situation and the players
  will say what they do and the GM will say "okay" or "make a talent
  check" (or "wait, let's clarify the fiction"). And around and
  around.

  Quill PCs have *talents* representing the difficult and powerful
  things they can do that might fail. PCs improve at *Talents* by
  earning and spending *experience* on their talents. Things like
  fighting with a particular weapon, perception, intimidation, casting
  wizard, cleric, or other spells (see the Quill Magic zine), sneak
  attacks, and even keeping animal companions are all *talents*. How
  capable a PC is at each *talent* is represented by a die size. They
  all start at d4 and can progress with *experience* through the other
  die sizes (d6, d8, d10, d12 and d20).

** Talent Checks

   When a PC does something that is a *talent*, like fighting with a
   weapon, intimidating someone, or casting a spell, roll a check. The
   *talent* specifies a *potential* based on your character sheet and
   the GM determines a *difficulty* based on the fictional situation.
   The player rolls their die for that *talent*. If they roll under
   the *difficulty*, that's a *miss*. If they roll over the
   *potential* that's a *bust* (it can be both). Otherwise it's a
   *hit*. Many talents base *potential* on other talents or even the
   same talent itself. In these cases use the /die size/ you have in
   the talent for *potential*. For example, ranged weapons specify
   "The lower of *Perception* and *Anticipation*". Say your
   *Perception* was *d10* and your *Anticipation* was *d6* your
   potential for *fighting* with ranged weapons would be *6* as it's
   the lower of 10 and 6.

   The outcomes of talent checks, especially the consequences for
   *misses* and *busts*, are what drive the game forward and unless
   otherwise stated use this as a guide.

   *Hit*: the player narrates their success

   *Miss*: the GM narrates the complication, setback, or obstacle that
   the failure causes. If the talent doesn't specify anything, invent
   something relevant to the situation.

   *Bust*: the GM narrates what the talent specifies or narrates a
   partial, incomplete, or fatally flawed success and possibly also a
   complication, setback, or obstacle it causes. A *bust* shouldn't be
   as bad as a *miss*.

   This table shows roughly what each *talent* die represents
   along with rough guidance for the GM to determine a check's
   *difficulty*

   | Die | Experience Level  | Challenging difficulty | Impossible difficulty |
   |-----+-------------------+------------------------+-----------------------|
   | d4  | No training       |                      2 |                     5 |
   | d6  | Some training     |                      3 |                     7 |
   | d8  | Well trained      |                      4 |                     9 |
   | d10 | Expert            |                      5 |                    11 |
   | d12 | Expert Specialist |                      6 |                    13 |
   | d20 | Godlike           |                     10 |                    21 |

** Advantage and Disadvantage

   Some rules grant you *advantage* or give you *disadvantage*. When
   you have *advantage* roll 2 dice and take the better die. When you
   have *disadvantage* roll 2 and take the worse. A *hit* is better
   than *bust* is better than *miss*

** Talent properties

   There are some properties that are named here, and then simply
   referenced in their talent description. Things like range for
   weapons, verbal and somatic components for spells etc.

*** Melee

    Potential: *Fight* when used in melee range

*** Ranged X Y

    Potential: Lower of *Perception* and *Anticipation* when used
    outside beyond melee range up to X feet. Every Y feet beyond that
    the target gains 1 *defense*

*** Reach

    Potential: *Fight* when used in melee range or just outside of
    melee range.

    When you *fight* just beyond melee range with a *reach* weapon you
    can keep one opponent from entering melee range until they find an
    opportunity to close. When you *fight* with a *reach* weapon in melee
    range you are *disadvantaged*

    The opponent may move into melee range whenever you *miss*. If they
    do you must *quick draw* at *disadvantage* in order switch to a
    melee weapon.

    The opponent may move into melee range whenever you *bust*. If they
    do you must *quick draw* with *advantage* in order to switch to a
    melee weapon.

*** Sunder

    When you *fight* and *bust* reduce the target's armor by 1 in
    addition to any other effects.

*** Finesse

    For the purposes of determining *defense* when fighting with a
    *finesse* weapon treat your number of injuries as one fewer. This
    makes your base unarmored defense 4 with no injuries.

*** Flexible

    Can be used either one handed or two handed.

* Advancement

  When you *push yourself* and *miss* using a *talent* mark it for an
  Experience Point (*XP*). Once you've marked enough *XP* for a talent
  you may advance it to its next highest die by paying its cost in
  *XP* during a long rest. All PCs have a d4 in every *talent*.

  | Next Die | XP Cost |
  |----------+---------|
  | d6       |       1 |
  | d8       |       2 |
  | d10      |       3 |
  | d12      |       4 |
  | d20      |       8 |

* Appendix A: Talents
** Animal Companionship

   Potential: Lower of *perception* and *Animal Companionship*-4

   When you dedicate a few hours and work to form a bond of
   companionship with an animal, either set up a new 5 step
   companionship clock or make progress on an existing companionship
   clock by rolling

   Difficulty:

   | Difficulty | Animal                                                  |
   |------------+---------------------------------------------------------|
   |          2 | Domestic animals (Dogs, Cats, Ravens, Horses)           |
   |          4 | Wild domestic Counterparts (Wolves, Big Cats, Raptors)  |
   |          6 | Other wild animals (Elephants, Reptiles, Bears, Jackal) |
   |          8 | Dire Animals                                            |
   |         10 | Beasts                                                  |
   |         12 | Monsters                                                |

   *Bust* Mark one tick on the clock

   *Miss* Remove one tick on the clock

** Anticipation

   Potential: *Anticipation*-4

   difficulty based on the plausibility and may ask for a flashback
   scene.

   *Hit* You anticipated it and are well prepared.

   *Bust* You anticipated it, but it came at a cost. Choose one
   depending on context.
   - It was expensive to prepare lower your coin die rank

   *Hit* They see things your way or do what you convinced them to do

   *Bust* They are convinced but get some important detail wrong. They
   do what you want but somehow manage to add another problem you now
   have to deal with

   *Miss* They are not convinced and are done talking. They want to

   Suddenly they have somewhere important to be. They may turn the
   tables and now expect you to do something for them instead.

** Face Death

   Potential: *Face Death* -4
   Difficulty: 4

   *Hit* You are incapacitated until you've healed an injury. Roll as per
   *long rest recovery* but without the requirement to eat and drink---you are
   unable to in a coma---and only once a day. If you don't heal an
   injury within 6 days you die.

   *Bust* You are incapacitated and must heal an injury fast. Roll as

   1. suffer 2 strain for unarmed or improvised weapon
   2. suffer 3 strain for a one handed weapon
   3. suffer 5 strain for a two handed weapon
   4. potentially more strain based on the circumstances. How high a
      fall was, how sharp the rocks are etc.

   *Miss* GM chooses one as appropriate
   1. suffer 8 strain for an unarmed attack
   2. suffer 10 strain for an improvised weapon
   3. suffer 1 injury if hit by a one handed weapon
   4. suffer 2 injuries if hit by a two handed weapon
   5. potentially more injuries based on the circumstances. How high a
      fall was, how sharp the rocks are etc.

** Face Danger

   When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat,
   envision your action and roll.  Describe the characters hopes or
   goal and what could go wrong then estimate the *difficulty* of
   avoiding the danger and the *potential* for things to go well.

   Roll any die you want.

   On a strong hit, you are successful.

   On a weak hit, you succeed, but face a troublesome cost. Choose one
   as appropriate...
   - You are delayed, lose advantage, or face a new danger
   - You are tired or hurt: Face Damage
   - You are dispirited or afraid: Take 2 Strain
   - You sacrifice resources: Suffer -1 supply as appropriate
   - something that could have gone wrong does go wrong

   On a miss, you fail, what could have gone wrong goes wrong

** Fight

   Potential: lower of *athletics* and *fight*-4

   When you *fight* toe to toe in melee (close) range roll with a

** Gather Information

   Potential: Gather information - 1

   When you search an area, ask questions, conduct an investigation,
   or follow a track, roll.

   On a strong hit, you discover something helpful and specific. The
   path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is
   made clear.

   On a weak hit, the information complicates things or introduces a
   new danger. Take 2 strain

   On a miss, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an
   unwelcome truth that undermines your goals. Take 3 strain

** Intimidation

   Potential: *Intimidation*-5
   - +1 if you have a credible reputation for violence or retaliation
     and they are aware of it
   - +1 if you brandish a deadly weapon
   - +1 if they are not wearing armor
   - +1 if they have a d4 in *fight*
   - +1 if they have a d12 in *fight*

   Roll when you threaten retaliation in order to get what you want.

   *Hit* You get what you want

   *Bust* You get what you want but whoever you intimidated holds 2
   against you until the end of the scene. They may spend one hold to
   give you disadvantage or to gain advantage against you for one
   check.

   *Miss* You don't get what you want and whoever you intimidated
   holds 3 and may spend them as above.

** Perception

   Potential: *Perception* - 2

   when a player wants to make a perception check they are saying "I
   want something important to be here" or "I need some hooks to move
   things forward" or "this is a good place for there to be something
   interesting, let's come up with something"

   The player starts by saying what they want to notice or find
   out. "is this person a danger to me?" "Who's in charge here?" "are
   there traps?"

   This check should start a conversation about what might be here to
   notice

   Hitchcock's Bomb, the players should be let in on it even if the
   characters are not. This roll should be about figuring out how much
   the PCs notice.

   GM honestly summarizes all the things available from the characters
   fictional position. Talk about what might be there with the group
   even if you have something in mind.

   *Hit* notice at least 3, at most all but 1

   *Bust* notice at least 1 at most all but 3 take 2 strain

   *Miss* Notice something misleading take 5 strain

** Quick Draw

   Potential: *Anticipation*

   Difficulty: 3 to draw one handed weapons, 5 for two handed (or
   weapons that can be used two handed)

   Roll to draw your weapon when you find yourself in a *fight*
   without it drawn or to switch from one weapon to another while in a
   *fight*

   *Hit* You draw quickly. You may immediately *fight*.

   *bust* You draw relatively quickly, you may immediately *fight*
   with *disadvantage*.

   *Miss* You draw the weapon, but not very quickly. Others have an
   opportunity to make a move

** Sneak Attack

   Potential:
   - *Quick Draw* when you use suddenness of attack to catch them off
     guard
   - *Anticipation* when you lay in wait
   - *Stealth* when you sneak up on them
   - *Perception* when they are fully engaged on something else (like
     fighting someone else, or taking aim at someone else, or
     equivalent attention otherwise

   Difficulty: Their defense as though they have 3 injuries

   When you attack someone who is unaware of your intention roll

   *Hit* as though they were hit by the weapon you wield. They *face
   damage* with *disadvantage*

   *Bust* You miss but may immediately *fight*

   *Miss* You missed the target and they may *quick draw* against a
   difficulty of your roll

** Undertake a Journey

   Potential: *supply(meals)* - 2

   When you travel across hazardous or unfamiliar lands, first
   estimate how far it is. Represent the distance by choosing a
   difficulty for the journey

   | Difficulty | Best Case Travel Time |
   |------------+-----------------------|
   |          2 | 1 day                 |
   |          3 | 3 days                |
   |          4 | 1 week                |
   |          5 | 2 weeks               |
   |          6 | 1 month               |
   |          7 | 3 months              |
   |          8 | 6 months              |
   |          9 | 9 months              |
   |         10 | 1 year                |
   |         11 | 3 years               |
   |         12 | 5 years               |

   Then, roll *supply (meals)*.

   *Hit*, you reach the destination in the best case travel time,
   envision the trip, reduce supply(meals, travel) by one. Set your
   strain to 5

   *bust* make it to a waypoint along the way. Reduce *supply(meals)*,
   and the difficulty of the journey by one. Take 2 strain. Roll again
   when ready to continue

   *miss* you are waylaid by a perilous event. reduce and *supply
   (meals)* by one. Take 4 strain. Roll again when ready to continue

* Appendix B: Special Talents
** Coin

   Potential: Higher of *perception* and *anticipation*

   Coin is not earned with experience but is worked for, traded for,
   found, stolen and so on. When you earn substantial *coin* increase
   the die size. PCs can't carry more than d12 coin on them.

   Roll when you spend *coin* to buy supplies or gear. The GM will
   come up with a difficulty representing the price based on rarity
   and cost to produce.

   *Hit* you can easily afford it

   *bust* You can afford it at some cost. Either don't buy it or
   reduce your coin die by one rank.

   *miss* You can afford it only at great cost (or not at all). Either
   don't buy it or reduce your coin by 3 ranks.

   Coin can be reduced to d0 (but not below)

** Supplies

   Supply dice are not bought with experience, they are bought with
   coin.

   Potential: infinity

   Difficulty: higher of 12 - *perception*, 12 - *anticipation*, and *strain*

   Before each rest roll for each supply (meals, ammunition, etc.) if
   you used it since your previous rest (always roll meals).

   *Hit* There are plenty more

   *miss* there are your die roll more. Track these individually
   without rolling *supplies*

* Appendix C: Gear
** Camping Kit

   You've got everything you need to make camp. Gain advantage on
   *short rest* recovery rolls.

** Armor

   When you get armor, do all the character sheet calculations for
   when you wear it so that you don't have to figure it all out during
   a scene.

* Notes

  - add talents with higher levels of abstraction
    - the fighting strategy moves like kite, wear them down, etc.
    - social manuvers, fame, reputation, etc.
  - add beliefs (maybe expand with fears and habits too?)
    - Acting in accordance with beleifs limit the amount of strain you
      take for doing it, beleifs let you push yourself with less stress
    - When invoking beliefs the rules make you talk about who the
      character is, what their power is about, etc.
** Fight notes
  - give weapons advantages for being fast and far reaching
  - Make shields great, they should nullify advantages from other
    weapons especially range and speed
  - Make weapon speed matter somehow.
  - Ranges of weapons
    - range (bows, thrown spears etc)
    - Pole weapons (spears, halberds etc)
    - Melee weapons (backups, swords, maces, axes)
    - Close weapons (can be used in grappling. knives, daggers)
  - outside of range you cannot even fight,
    - 1 level inside of range you are at disadvantage, more than that
      you cannot fight
    - Closing range is dangerous
    - Shields make closing range much safer
  - Weapon speed matters. swords hit first, axes damage armor, hurt more.

  - let fights be clocks or progress tracks, handle them like
    ironsworn.
    - when you start a fight against a leviathain anything reasonable
      can be progress in the fight, even things that are not directly
      related to fighting it like crafting an appropriate weapon,
      learning the creatures weakness through observation, waiting
      until it's asleep to start and so on.
    - Every move, of course, when you are in a fight gives the foe an
      opportunity to gain advantage as well.
    - frame fights as a battle for advantage (wounding the other of
      course is an advantage, but so is building encampments, studying
      their history, taunting or frightning them, or running them out
      of supplies)
  - fights are when opponents are both aware of the other and are both
    actively engaged in the fight
    - It may enter and exit various arenas and scopes though.
      - social, physical, psychological arenas for example
      - moment to moment, hour to hour, day to day, week, month, year
        scopes are all possible.

** The order to learn the game
*** The Conversation

    Agenda and purpose:
    - To construct a unanimously agreed upon fictional reality together
    - To follow a procedure and set of rules to guide the process
      - We consent as equals to the procedure and rules, so that ascent
        to the results is fair and fast

    The foundation is the conversation, everyone talks about what the
    rules mean to the fiction and what the fiction means to the rules.

**** Division of responsibility

     Both narrative responsibility and rules referee responsibility

     usually the GM and PC division, but other divisions could be
     swapped in

     Design for solo first, publish for guided with a solo option

*** Risk taking, Conflict, and Rolling Dice
    Die size, Potential, Difficulty
    Hit Bust Miss

    If there is a move that covers the situation use that move.

    common rules are factored out into a glossary of terms that moves
    will reference like in magic the gathering

**** Take a risk

     When you take a risk the GM decides a potential, difficulty, and
     die size for you to use, and sets out what happens on a hit bust
     and miss

     When you do something that is in conflict with someone else roll
     as taking a risk. The risk is that someone will be able to stop
     you, will retaliate, or will undo what you've done.

*** It's Moves all the way down

    It's moves that make the difference between one format/setting/etc
    and it's moves all the way down.

    *Moves Chain* When you push yourself you might need to endure
    strain and when you endure strain you might then need to face
    damage then maybe face death When you fight you might need to face
    damage and so on.

**** Basic moves

     Fiction and cues determining dice that affect the fiction

**** Incremental Moves

     Fiction and cues determining dice that affect fiction and cues

***** Endure Damage
***** Face Death
***** Rest
***** Advancement
***** Push yourself
***** Endure Strain
***** Fight
***** Faction turns as moves

   /envisioning.../ Heads north along the main road, there is an old
   ruins in the woods there have been rumors of treasure in.

   /Always ask, what is the goal?/ The goal is to get the treasure in
   the ruins nearby.

   /Then always say okay or ask what first what might go wrong? so
   what first? what might go wrong?/ gotta find my way there... It's

   Hit (3)

   There they are, just there in that gully, smaller than I remember,
   I must have grown up since I'd been here last. There are a few
   foundations and a few fallen walls.

   /I suppose I could roll on an encounter table here, but let's say
   there is a giant rat/

   I approach spear drawn to see many animal tracks in the area. I
   hear scurrying in an underground room nearby so I hide near the
   entrance, and throw a bit of food out in the open.

   /always ask what's the goal?/

   I want to lure the creature out without being noticed so I can
   sneak attack it.

   /What might go wrong?/

   - It might not care about the food and might not come out.
   - It might already know where I am and care more about me than the
     food. (require anticipation or get attacked simultaneously

   *Face Danger* (generic roll?)

   - Potential 5
   - Difficulty 3
   - Die d10

   The Rat pounces straight at me but is not ready for the spear point
   in their path. I've anticipated their pounce well and they impale
   themselves through the heart on my braced spear.

   I cautiously make my way into the underground room.

   /In a GMed game, what's here is whatever the GM decides, in a solo
   game we can roll for it? or just envision it?/

   roll on the [theme

   82: Enemy... (they) The Ratparent (3hd)

   A brooding hermit whose pet, or guard animal, or something had just
   impaled itself on my now bloody spear is in a wild, nervous,
   fearful rage.

   *Perception*

   /start with the goal/ I want to know how dangerous this hermit
   is. To me right now, and to others passing along the road.

   The honest situation. The hermit is a cannibal who raises giant
   rats and grabs people from the road north of Foxhollow. There are
   tales of monsters in the woods here.

   The evidence that's here...
   - The personal effects of a few different people
   - A workbench stained with what could be blood?
   - Pots and jars with preserved organs in them
   - a plate of liver leftovers
   - cages  with a few baby giant rats

   It's such a charged situation with the Ratparent raging and I don't
   have much time or attention to spare so some of these things that
   will be obvious when I have a chance to take a careful look could
   easily be overlooked now.

   - Potential 6
   - Difficulty 4 (it's charged and there is a distraction and danger
     I could lower the difficulty to take a closer look around but
     would have to face danger from the Ratparent)
   - Die d8

   Bust (7) Notice all but 3, any 2 take 2 strain
   - The personal effects of a few different people

   /Start with your goal/ I'm trying to understand what situation I'm
   in, and I'm also trying to get them talking and calming down.

   *Convince* them to tell me what the situation is.

   - Potential 2
   - Difficulty 3
   - Die d4

   "Get out!" they yell, waving a kitchen knife approaching me.
