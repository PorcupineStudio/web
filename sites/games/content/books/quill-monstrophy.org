Quill was influenced by a bunch of great prior work.

*Dungeons & Dragons* by Wizards of the Coast

*Blades in the Dark* by John Harper

*Apocalypse World* by Meguey and D. Vincent Baker

Thank you for the path you blazed!

The object of Quill is to *become powerful* by the *experience of
dangerous adventure* but you might not because the *danger is real*
and *you could fucking die*.

These are not creatures like kobolds, beholders or even dragons.
Monsters in Quill are unique adversaries that pose an imminent and
dangerous threat to the worlds social and moral order.

* Making Monsters

* Fighting Monsters
