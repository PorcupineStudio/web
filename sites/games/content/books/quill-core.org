{{{ To Dos }}}

The object of *Quill* is to *achieve your goals* but you might not
because people are *violent* and have *goals of their own*, many of
them are *villains*, and *the world is dangerous and unfair*.

I'm assuming that you are familiar with role playing games. Quill
won't explain much of what is common to most of them so If you are new
to roleplaying, I hope a little internet research will clear anything
up. If not please let me know either on Twitter (@jessebmiller),
through email <jesse@jessebmiller.com> or on the [Porcupine Studio
chat](chat.porcupine.studio) (Discord at the time of this writing).

Quill Adventure was influenced by a bunch of great prior work.

*Apocalypse World* by Meguey and D. Vincent Baker

*Dungeon World* by Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel

*Blades in the Dark* by John Harper

*Ironsworn* by Shawn Tompkins

*Dungeons & Dragons* by Wizards of the Coast

* It's a Conversation

  To play Quill is to have a conversation with a group and invent a
  shared fictional narrative (the fiction) mediated by the rules in
  this book. The rules give authority over different parts of the
  shared fictional relaity to different people. The rules also limit,
  in specific ways, what each group member can establish in the
  fiction often requiring a dice roll to determine if some action,
  decision, activity, etc. had the intended results or if there are
  unintended consequences.

  Before starting a game the whole group must agree to play by the
  same set of established rules. Start with the rules as written, and
  try to play long enough to be familiar with how they work in the
  group you are playing with, but if anyone either before starting or
  through the course of play does not consent to any of the
  established rules, that player speaks up and the group establishes a
  set of rules that everyone at the table consents to. If unanimous
  consensus and consent can't be reached the game can't continue.
  That's okay! It's not a failure to discover that the group doesn't
  want to play the same game! That's a success!  With that discovered
  everyone can go play the games they actually want to play with the
  people who also want to play them.

** Safety

   At the beginning of *every session*, mention /the X card/, and ask
   if anyone has any /lines/ or /veils/ they want to have in place for
   the session. Something freeing and great happens when the game is
   safe and everyone knows what lines not to cross and trusts that
   everyone will speak up if something makes them uncomfortable
   trusting that the group will change it without judgment. Everyone
   can go a little deeper, safe in the knowledge that if they go too
   far for anyone, someone will speak up and everyone will work to make
   it comfortable and fun for everyone again.

** The Players and The Guide

   At a high level this is a pretty standard tabletop role playing
   game. All but one of the group are *The Players* and each has
   responsibility for and authority over a single character in the
   fiction. One of the group is *The Guide* who has responsibility for
   and authority over the other, non-player characters (NPCs), the
   world they inhabit, and the interpretation of the rules as
   established.

*** Judgment calls

    When you play, youâ€™ll make several key judgment calls just like you
    do in Blades in the Dark, in fact this text is basically copied
    from the blades SRD. Everyone can contribute, but either a player
    or the guide gets final authority for each:

    - Which activities are reasonable as a solution to a problem? Can
      this person be intimidated?  Must we get force open this rusty
      lock with a pry bar. or could we get out the thieves tools and
      pick it open? The players have final say.
    - How dangerous and how effective is a given activity in this
      circumstance? How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very
      little or a whole lot? The guide has final say.
    - Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a
      given circumstance? Does this fall from the roof break your leg?
      Do the constables merely become suspicious or do they already
      have you trapped? The guide has final say.
    - Does this situation call for a move, and which one? Is your
      character in position to make that fight move or must they first
      get close the distance? The guide has final say.

*** Agendas and principles

    The players and the guide both have their agendas, the things they
    are responsible for and should aim for to make the game click.

**** Players agenda and principles

     * Make your character real
     * Keep what you know separate from what they know
     * Begin and end with the fiction
     * Play to find out what happens

**** Guide agenda and principles

     * Make the setting alive
     * Name everyone

** Playing Solo

   The rules should give you enough to both play a character and guide
   the game at the same time. The biggest difference when playing solo
   is that there is no one to have a conversation with, so you write
   the fiction as you establish it in whatever medium you want. I like
   to keep a record of what moves were made, what the dice rolled, and
   everything that happened mechanically as well so that future
   readers (including yourself) can see how the game happened. You
   still follow all the rules, you are just taking on the
   responsibility of both player and guide.

* Moves

  Most rules come in the form of moves and will say when they are
  relevant and also how to handle them. Whenever a character does
  something that a move covers, follow the instructions in the
  move. Whenever you want the mechanical effects of a move you have to
  do the thing it covers. Moves work in Quill like they do in
  Apocolypse World, and Monsterhearts, and Ironsworn.

* The Dice

  Whenever a move says to roll, follow these instructions to see how
  it goes. There are three possible outcomes and three parameters that
  need to be established and the text of the moves will tell you how
  to set everything up. The whole group is encouraged be involved in
  discussing it but what the character is trying to do is up to the
  player, and the guide has final say on the rest.

  *Possible outcomes*
  - *Hit*: The player says what they are doing and the outcome they are going
    for so they establish what happens on a hit
  - *Bust*: The character overextends, pushes too hard, or causes
    unintended consequences. This outcome is established by the guide
    and will often be the outcome that the player was going for but
    with an additional complication or unintended consequence.
  - *Miss*: The character does not succeed. The outcome they were
    going for does not occur and there is some complication or problem
    instead.

  *Roll parameters*
  - The *die* to roll, player's choice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20)
    which represents the character's effort, striving, enthusiasm (or
    over-enthusiasm).
  - The *potential* which represents an upper limit to how well things
    can go given the circumstances; the character's experience and
    true capabilities
  - The *difficulty* which represents how easy it is to fail at this.

  Once the player and the guide sets the three parameters and the
  three outcomes the player rolls whichever die they want. If they roll
  higher than the potential, that's a bust. If they roll lower than
  the difficulty, that's a miss. Otherwise it's a hit. Note that it's
  possible to set this up so that both a bust and a miss can happen on
  the same roll in which case both outcomes occur.

** Advantage and Disadvantage

   Some rules grant you *advantage* or put you at *disadvantage*. When
   you are *advantaged* roll 2 dice and take your choice of the
   results. When you have *disadvantage* roll 2 and the Guide chooses
   the worst---even if it kills you.

* Strain

  Mental and physical fatigue, cuts and bruises, sleep deprivation,
  stress and encumbrance all contribute to and are abstracted by
  *strain*. Keep track of it on your character sheet.

  Your *strain* is the minimum difficulty for all your rolls

** Push Yourself

   You can push yourself on any *move* and take as many of the
   following as you want as many times as you want but declare it all
   and take the *strain* before you make the move.

   - take 1 *strain* and reduce the difficulty by 2---you cannot
     reduce difficulty below your strain
   - take 1 *strain* and increase your effective *potential* by 2
   - take 2 *strain* and gain advantage or lose disadvantage
     (take this twice to go from disadvantage to advantage)
   - take 1d10 *strain* to get an automatic *hit*
   - take 1d6 *strain* to get an automatic *bust*

* Core Moves

  Characters all get the basic moves. Each one starts with a potential
  of 3

** Anticipate

   Roll when you think you could have *anticipated* something. Say how
   you anticipated it and how you are prepared. The GM will set a
   difficulty based on the plausibility and may ask for a flashback
   scene.

   *Hit* You anticipated it and are well prepared.

   *Bust* You anticipated it, but it came at a cost. Choose one
   depending on context.
   - It was expensive to prepare. Reduce your *coin amount* by one.
   - You owe someone a favor
   - The anticipation was stressful take 1 *strain*

   *Miss* You spent your energy and preparation anticipating something
   else. Choose one from above

** Convince the Skeptical

   Roll when you try to get someone to believe something they don't,
   see things your way, or do something they need convincing is in
   their interest. Say how you are convincing them, or role play the
   interaction then the guide will determine a difficulty.

   *Hit* They see things your way or do what you convinced them to do

   *Bust* They are convinced but get some important detail wrong. They
   do what you want---or something similar---but somehow manage to add
   another problem you now have to deal with

   *Miss* They are not convinced and are done talking. They want to
   end the conversation or interaction as quickly as possible.
   Suddenly they have somewhere important to be. They may turn the
   tables and now expect you to do something for them instead.

** Face Death

   Difficulty: The number of injuries

   Whenever you take an injury *face death*. Write down a short
   description of the injury on your character sheet.

   *Hit* You are able to press on despite your injuries

   *Bust* You are staggered and overwhelmed by your injuries. Note the
   die you rolled next to this injury. You cannot roll that die until
   you heal this injury. Everyone has *advantage* against you until
   you heal this injury.

   *Miss* You die

** Take Damage

   Difficulty: The damage taken

   Roll when you are struck by a weapon, fall from a great height, or
   otherwise *take damage*.

   *Hit* GM chooses one as appropriate
   1. suffer 1 *strain* from an unarmed attacker
   1. suffer 2 *strain* from an improvised weapon
   2. suffer 3 *strain* from a one handed weapon
   3. suffer 5 *strain* from a two handed weapon
   4. potentially more *strain* based on the circumstances. How high a
      fall was, how sharp the rocks are etc.

   *Miss* GM chooses one as appropriate
   1. suffer 6 *strain* for an unarmed attack
   2. suffer 10 *strain* for an improvised weapon
   3. suffer 1 *injury* if hit by a one handed weapon
   4. suffer 2 *injuries* if hit by a two handed weapon
   5. potentially more *injuries* based on the circumstances. How high a
      fall was, how sharp the rocks are etc.

   *Face death* if you suffered an *injury*

** Fight {{{ like Ironsworn Enter the Fray }}}

   {{{ Make weapon moves for attacks (adventure not core?) }}}

   {{{ Make a grapple move (adventure not core?) }}}

   {{{ Make a generic strike move that differentiates improvised,
   ranged, one handed, and two handed weapons}}}

   Roll when you *fight* toe to toe in melee (close) range.

   Difficulty: Your opponent's {{{*defense*}}}.

   When you *fight* with a *weapon* that weapon's properties replace
   *fight's* properties.

   *Hit* The target must *face damage* as rolled

   *Bust* Suffer 1 strain

   *Miss* Suffer 2 strain

** Gather Information

   When you search an area, ask questions, conduct an investigation,
   or follow tracks or a trail, roll.

   *Hit* You discover something helpful and specific. The path you
   must follow or action you must take to make progress is made clear.

   *Bust* The information complicates things or introduces a new
   danger.

   *Miss* Your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an
   unwelcome truth that undermines your goals.

** Improve

   Mark experience on any *move* you make when all of the following
   are true:
   - the difficulty is higher than your *strain* (you don't learn when
     you are worn out)
   - you roll a die higher than your potential (you don't learn when
     you aren't reaching past your current abilities)
   - you *miss* (you don't learn when you don't fail)

   When you've marked an amount of experience equal to your potential
   with a move, *improve* that move's potential by one and erase all
   experience marked on it.

** Undertake a Journey

   When you travel across hazardous or unfamiliar lands, first
   estimate how far it is. Represent the distance by choosing a
   difficulty for the journey

   | Difficulty | Best Case Travel Time |
   |------------+-----------------------|
   |          2 | 1 day                 |
   |          3 | 3 days                |
   |          4 | 1 week                |
   |          5 | 2 weeks               |
   |          6 | 1 month               |
   |          7 | 3 months              |
   |          8 | 6 months              |
   |          9 | 9 months              |
   |         10 | 1 year                |
   |         11 | 3 years               |
   |         12 | 5 years               |

   Then roll

   *Hit*, you reach the destination in the best case travel time,
   envision the trip, reduce all {{{ travel supplies }}} by one. Set
   your strain to 5

   *Bust* You make it to a waypoint along the way. Reduce all {{{
   travel supplies }}} and the difficulty of the journey by one. Take
   2 strain. Envision the waypoint {{{ probably roll on an encounter
   table (adventure?), make camp that crap }}}

   *miss* you are waylaid by a perilous event. reduce all {{{ travel
   supplies }}} by one. Take 4 strain. Roll again when ready to
   continue

** Rest and Recover

   There are *short rests* and *long rests*. Each require you to eat
   and drink. Short rests take about an hour. Long rests take at least
   8 hours.

   After a *short rest* recover 1d6 *strain*

   After a *long rest* recover all *strain*.

   After a *long rest* you may roll to recover from an injury.

   Difficulty: Your number of *injuries*

   *Hit* You recover from the *injury*

   *Bust* You recover from the *injury* but are weak from the
   ordeal. Suffer 3 *Strain*

   *Miss* You do not recover and are weak from the ordeal. Suffer 3 *Strain*

** {{{ Make Camp }}}
** {{{ Make a Home }}}

   Settling into a home in a city or town or the country

** {{{ Work Art }}}
** {{{ Work a Trade }}}
* Consumption Moves
** Make and Spend Coin

   Keep track of the *amount* of *coin* you have

   Coin is not earned with experience but is worked for, traded for,
   found, stolen and so on. When you get your hands on substantial
   *coin* roll d6. If it's higher than your current *amount* increase
   your *amount* by one.

   | Amount | Potential | Rough cash on hand |
   |--------+-----------+--------------------|
   |      1 |         2 | 10 Copper          |
   |      2 |         4 | 10 Silver          |
   |      3 |         5 | 10 Gold            |
   |      4 |         6 | Gold               |
   |      5 |         7 | 1000 Gold          |
   |      6 |        15 | 10000 Gold         |

   Roll (ignoring strain) when you spend *coin* to buy services,
   supplies, gear, or items. You can find prices in the {{{ gear
   section }}}

   *Hit* you can easily afford it

   *bust* You can afford it at some cost. Either don't buy it or
   reduce your coin amount by one.

   *miss* You can afford it only at great cost (or not at all). Either
   don't buy it or reduce your coin amount by three.

** Stock and Use Supplies (type)

   Supply dice are not bought with experience, they are bought with
   coin---or found or stolen.  When you acquire *supplies* of a type
   {{{ listed in the gear section }}} roll d6. If it's higher than
   your current *amount* increase your *amount* by one.

   | Amount | Potential |
   |--------+-----------|
   |      1 |         4 |
   |      2 |         6 |
   |      3 |         8 |
   |      4 |        10 |
   |      5 |        12 |
   |      6 |        16 |

   Difficulty: 4

   Roll (ignoring strain) when you use some supply of a type for the
   first time since a long rest.

   *Hit* You've got plenty

   *miss* Reduce The *amount* to 0. There are 4 more.

   *bust* reduce your *amount* of the supply by 1 but you've still got
   plenty---unless you reduced the *amount* to 0, then there are 4 more.
