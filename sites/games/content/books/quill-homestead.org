The object of Quill homestead is to *build independent stability* by
*homesteading* but you might not because *stability is fickle* and
*disaster* could strike at any time.

Quill Homestead was influenced by a bunch of great prior work.

*Apocalypse World* by Meguey and D. Vincent Baker

*Blades in the Dark* by John Harper

*Ironsworn* by Shawn Tompkins

*Stardew Valley* by Eric Barone

* The Conversation

  To play Quill is to have a conversation with a group and invent a
  shared fictional narrative (the fiction) mediated by the rules in
  this book. The rules give authority over different parts of the
  shared fictional relaity to different people. The rules also limit,
  in specific ways, what each group member can establish in the
  fiction often requiring a dice roll to determine if some action,
  decision, activity, etc. had the intended results or if there are
  unintended consequences.

  Before starting a game the whole group must agree to play by the
  same set of established rules. Start with the rules as written, and
  try to play long enough to be familiar with how they work in the
  group you are playing with, but if anyone either before starting or
  through the course of play does not consent to any of the
  established rules, that player speaks up and the group establishes a
  set of rules that everyone at the table consents to. If unanimous
  consensus and consent can't be reached the game can't continue.
  That's okay! It's not a failure to discover that the group doesn't
  want to play the same game! That's a success!  With that discovered
  everyone can go play the games they actually want to play with the
  people who also want to play them.

** Safety

   At the beginning of *every session*, mention /the X card/, and ask
   if anyone has any /lines/ or /veils/ they want to have in place for
   the session. Something freeing and great happens when the game is
   safe and everyone knows what lines not to cross and trusts that
   everyone will speak up if something makes them uncomfortable
   trusting that the group will change it without judgment. Everyone
   can go a little deeper, safe in the knowledge that if they go too
   far for anyone, someone will speak up and everyone will work to make
   it comfortable and fun for everyone again.

** The Players and The Guide

   At a high level this is a pretty standard tabletop role playing
   game. All but one of the group are *The Players* and each has
   responsibility for and authority over a single character in the
   fiction. One of the group is *The Guide* who has responsibility for
   and authority over the other, non-player characters (NPCs), the
   world they inhabit, and the interpretation of the rules as
   established.

*** Judgment calls

    When you play, youâ€™ll make several key judgment calls just like you
    do in Blades in the Dark, in fact this text is basically copied
    from the blades SRD. Everyone can contribute, but either a player
    or the guide gets final authority for each:

    - Which activities are reasonable as a solution to a problem? Can
      this person be intimidated?  Must we get force open this rusty
      lock with a pry bar. or could we get out the thieves tools and
      pick it open? The players have final say.
    - How dangerous and how effective is a given activity in this
      circumstance? How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very
      little or a whole lot? The guide has final say.
    - Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a
      given circumstance? Does this fall from the roof break your leg?
      Do the constables merely become suspicious or do they already
      have you trapped? The guide has final say.
    - Does this situation call for a move, and which one? Is your
      character in position to make that fight move or must they first
      get close the distance? The guide has final say.

*** Agendas and principles

    The players and the guide both have their agendas, the things they
    are responsible for and should aim for to make the game click.

**** Players agenda and principles

     * Make your character real
     * Keep what you know separate from what they know
     * Begin and end with the fiction
     * Play to find out what happens

**** Guide agenda and principles

     * Make the setting alive
     * Name everyone

** Playing Solo

   The rules should give you enough to both play a character and guide
   the game at the same time. The biggest difference when playing solo
   is that there is no one to have a conversation with, so you write
   the fiction as you establish it in whatever medium you want. I like
   to keep a record of what moves were made, what the dice rolled, and
   everything that happened mechanically as well so that future
   readers (including yourself) can see how the game happened. You
   still follow all the rules, you are just taking on the
   responsibility of both player and guide.

* Moves

  Most rules come in the form of moves and will say when they are
  relevant and also how to handle them. Whenever a character does
  something that a move covers, follow the instructions in the
  move. Whenever you want the mechanical effects of a move you have to
  do the thing it covers. Moves work in Quill like they do in
  Apocolypse World, and Monsterhearts, and Ironsworn.

* The Dice

  Whenever a move says to roll, follow these instructions to see how
  it goes. There are three possible outcomes and three parameters that
  need to be established and the text of the moves will tell you how
  to set everything up. The whole group is encouraged be involved in
  discussing it but what the character is trying to do is up to the
  player, and the guide has final say on the rest.

  *Possible outcomes*
  - *Hit*: The player says what they are doing and the outcome they are going
    for so they establish what happens on a hit
  - *Bust*: The character overextends, pushes too hard, or causes
    unintended consequences. This outcome is established by the guide
    and will often be the outcome that the player was going for but
    with an additional complication or unintended consequence.
  - *Miss*: The character does not succeed. The outcome they were
    going for does not occur and there is some complication or problem
    instead.

  *Roll parameters*
  - The *die* to roll (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, or d20) which represents
    the character's experience and capabilities
  - The *potential* which represents an upper limit to how well things
    can go given the circumstances
  - The *difficulty* which represents how easy it is to fail at this.

  Once the player and the guide sets the three parameters and the
  three outcomes the player rolls the die. If they roll higher than
  the potential, that's a bust. If they roll lower than the
  difficulty, that's a miss. Otherwise it's a hit. Note that it's
  possible to set this up so that both a bust and a miss can happen on
  the same roll in which case both outcomes occur.
* Basic Moves

  Every character gets all the basic moves

** Anticipation

   Potential: *Anticipation*-4

   Roll when you think you could have *anticipated* something. Say how
   you anticipated it and how you are prepared. The GM will set a
   difficulty based on the plausibility and may ask for a flashback
   scene.

   *Hit* You anticipated it and are well prepared.

   *Bust* You anticipated it, but it came at a cost. Choose one
   depending on context.
   - It was expensive to prepare lower your coin die rank
   - You owe someone a favor
   - The anticipation was stressful take 1d6 stress

   *Miss* You spent your energy and preparation anticipating something
   else. Choose one from above

** Athletics

   TODO

** Coin

   Potential: Higher of *perception* and *anticipation*

   Coin is not earned with experience but is worked for, traded for,
   found, stolen and so on. When you earn substantial *coin* increase
   the die size. PCs can't carry more than d12 coin on them.

   Roll when you spend *coin* to buy supplies or gear. The GM will
   come up with a difficulty representing the price based on rarity
   and cost to produce.

   *Hit* you can easily afford it

   *bust* You can afford it at some cost. Either don't buy it or
   reduce your coin die by one rank.

   *miss* You can afford it only at great cost (or not at all). Either
   don't buy it or reduce your coin by 3 ranks.

   Coin can be reduced to d0 (but not below)

** Convince

   Potential: *Convince*-2

   Roll when you try to get someone to see things your way, or do
   something they wouldn't do on their own.

   *Hit* They see things your way or do what you convinced them to do

   *Bust* They are convinced but get some important detail wrong. They
   do what you want but somehow manage to add another problem you now
   have to deal with

   *Miss* They are not convinced and are done talking. They want to
   end the conversation or interaction as quickly as possible.
   Suddenly they have somewhere important to be. They may turn the
   tables and now expect you to do something for them instead.

** Face Death

   Potential: *Face Death* -4
   Difficulty: 4

   *Hit* You are incapacitated until you've healed an injury. Roll as per
   *long rest recovery* but without the requirement to eat and drink---you are
   unable to in a coma---and only once a day. If you don't heal an
   injury within 6 days you die.

   *Bust* You are incapacitated and must heal an injury fast. Roll as
   per *long rest recovery* as above. If you don't heal an injury you
   die.

   *Miss* You die

** Face Damage

   Potential: Infinity

   Difficulty: The damage faced

   Roll when you are hit by a weapon, fall from a great height, or
   otherwise *face damage*.

   *Hit* GM chooses one as appropriate
   1. suffer 2 strain for unarmed or improvised weapon
   2. suffer 3 strain for a one handed weapon
   3. suffer 5 strain for a two handed weapon
   4. potentially more strain based on the circumstances. How high a
      fall was, how sharp the rocks are etc.

   *Miss* GM chooses one as appropriate
   1. suffer 8 strain for an unarmed attack
   2. suffer 10 strain for an improvised weapon
   3. suffer 1 injury if hit by a one handed weapon
   4. suffer 2 injuries if hit by a two handed weapon
   5. potentially more injuries based on the circumstances. How high a
      fall was, how sharp the rocks are etc.

** Face Danger

   When you attempt something risky or react to an imminent threat,
   envision your action and roll.  Describe the characters hopes or
   goal and what could go wrong then estimate the *difficulty* of
   avoiding the danger and the *potential* for things to go well.

   Roll any die you want.

   On a strong hit, you are successful.

   On a weak hit, you succeed, but face a troublesome cost. Choose one
   as appropriate...
   - You are delayed, lose advantage, or face a new danger
   - You are tired or hurt: Face Damage
   - You are dispirited or afraid: Take 2 Strain
   - You sacrifice resources: Suffer -1 supply as appropriate
   - something that could have gone wrong does go wrong

   On a miss, you fail, what could have gone wrong goes wrong

** Fight

   Potential: lower of *athletics* and *fight*-4

   When you *fight* toe to toe in melee (close) range roll with a
   difficulty of your opponent's *defense*.

   When you *fight* with a *weapon* that weapon's properties replace
   *fight's* properties.

   *Hit* The target must *face damage* as rolled

   *Bust* The target's next roll is at *disadvantage*

   *Miss* Your next roll is at *disadvantage*

** Gather Information

   Potential: Gather information - 1

   When you search an area, ask questions, conduct an investigation,
   or follow a track, roll.

   On a strong hit, you discover something helpful and specific. The
   path you must follow or action you must take to make progress is
   made clear.

   On a weak hit, the information complicates things or introduces a
   new danger. Take 2 strain

   On a miss, your investigation unearths a dire threat or reveals an
   unwelcome truth that undermines your goals. Take 3 strain

** Intimidation

   Potential: *Intimidation*-5
   - +1 if you have a credible reputation for violence or retaliation
     and they are aware of it
   - +1 if you brandish a deadly weapon
   - +1 if they are not wearing armor
   - +1 if they have a d4 in *fight*
   - +1 if they have a d12 in *fight*

   Roll when you threaten retaliation in order to get what you want.

   *Hit* You get what you want

   *Bust* You get what you want but whoever you intimidated holds 2
   against you until the end of the scene. They may spend one hold to
   give you disadvantage or to gain advantage against you for one
   check.

   *Miss* You don't get what you want and whoever you intimidated
   holds 3 and may spend them as above.

** Perception

   Potential: *Perception* - 2

   when a player wants to make a perception check they are saying "I
   want something important to be here" or "I need some hooks to move
   things forward" or "this is a good place for there to be something
   interesting, let's come up with something"

   The player starts by saying what they want to notice or find
   out. "is this person a danger to me?" "Who's in charge here?" "are
   there traps?"

   This check should start a conversation about what might be here to
   notice

   Hitchcock's Bomb, the players should be let in on it even if the
   characters are not. This roll should be about figuring out how much
   the PCs notice.

   GM honestly summarizes all the things available from the characters
   fictional position. Talk about what might be there with the group
   even if you have something in mind.

   *Hit* notice at least 3, at most all but 1

   *Bust* notice at least 1 at most all but 3 take 2 strain

   *Miss* Notice something misleading take 5 strain

** Supplies

   Supply dice are not bought with experience, they are bought with
   coin.

   Potential: infinity

   Difficulty: higher of 12 - *perception*, 12 - *anticipation*, and *strain*

   Before each rest roll for each supply (meals, ammunition, etc.) if
   you used it since your previous rest (always roll meals).

   *Hit* There are plenty more

   *miss* there are your die roll more. Track these individually
   without rolling *supplies*

** Survival
** Undertake a Journey

   Potential: *supply(meals)* - 2

   When you travel across hazardous or unfamiliar lands, first
   estimate how far it is. Represent the distance by choosing a
   difficulty for the journey

   | Difficulty | Best Case Travel Time |
   |------------+-----------------------|
   |          2 | 1 day                 |
   |          3 | 3 days                |
   |          4 | 1 week                |
   |          5 | 2 weeks               |
   |          6 | 1 month               |
   |          7 | 3 months              |
   |          8 | 6 months              |
   |          9 | 9 months              |
   |         10 | 1 year                |
   |         11 | 3 years               |
   |         12 | 5 years               |

   Then, roll *supply (meals)*.

   *Hit*, you reach the destination in the best case travel time,
   envision the trip, reduce supply(meals, travel) by one. Set your
   strain to 5

   *bust* make it to a waypoint along the way. Reduce *supply(meals)*,
   and the difficulty of the journey by one. Take 2 strain. Roll again
   when ready to continue

   *miss* you are waylaid by a perilous event. reduce and *supply
   (meals)* by one. Take 4 strain. Roll again when ready to continue
