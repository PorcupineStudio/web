Let's talk about a specific dice mechanic. It's not unique or
original, and is heavily inspired by other games but I like it for a
few reasons which I'll lay out here and then I'll describe the
mechanic in detail.

*Accessibility*. No specialized dice and minimal mental math is
required, just counting and comparison

*Speed*. It's very fast to operate and determine success and failure

*Narrative relevance*. Talking through the complexity of the situation
guides the narration to describe and better understand the challenge
at hand. It tells everyone at the table what the dice mean in terms of
the fiction

*Large design space*. It offers a lot of hooks, designers can describe,
in the rules, what increases or decreases difficulty and
complexity. They can let players push their luck by voluntarily adding
complexity in exchange for greater reward if successful.

Here it is

The mechanic defines a challenge as a difficulty and complexity based
on what a character is trying to do, and the situation they are trying
to do it in. Those define what needs to be rolled for a roll to be a
success. For example a spell like "Giant Strength" might be defined as
having a difficulty of 3 and a complexity of 1. The situation might
increase the complexity by 1 if there are complicating circumstances,
like the caster being exhausted or starving. Let's look at an example
game group that decided the difficulty is 3 and the complexity is
2. It's time to roll the dice

The player whose character is casting the spell will roll a number of
dice equal to the characters relevant experience. In the case of our
example if the character has 5 points in "Giant Strength" so the
player rolls 5 dice. These dice are always standard six sided
dice. The difficulty determines how high the dice each need to be
rolled and the complexity determines how many high rolls are needed
for a success

So the player needs to roll 2 (complexity) over 3 (difficulty) out of
5 (experience). Say the 5 dice roll 1, 1, 3, 5, and 6. This is a
success with two of the dice (5 and 6) over the difficulty (3). A roll
of 2, 2, 3, 3, and 6 would fail as only one of them is over the
difficulty

These requirements are notated as "2 over 3", or more generally
"complexity over difficulty"

To illustrate the flexibility I mentioned above, consider a "heal"
spell that has a base difficulty of 1, complexity of 1 and heals 1
damage on success. The designer could add choices like increasing the
number of targets healed by 1 per difficulty, increasing the distance
those targets can be healed at by 1 complexity per 5 feet away, and
increasing the amount healed by 1 per difficulty.

A new character without much experience could then heal 3 damage on a
roll of 1 over 3 and an experienced character could heal 2 allies both
5 feet away of 4 damage on a roll of 4 over 4.

A spell like that scales with the amount of experience the character
has put into it. It's accessible and valuable for new characters and
experienced ones.

This is the basic mechanic that I'm establishing as the core of the
Cast system, and I'll modify or change it if it's warranted but I'm
pretty excited about the potential of this one and I'd love to hear

What you think?
