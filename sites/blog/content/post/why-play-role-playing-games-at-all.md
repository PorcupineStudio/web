Play allows us to "explore the possible" according to Stewart Brown in
his TED talk Play is more than just fun. Body play is "a spontaneous
desire to get ourselves out of gravity." Object play is "the hand in
search of a brain; the brain is in search of a hand; and play is the
medium by which those two are linked". "[Play] is born by curiosity
and exploration. But it has to be safe exploration".

Safe exploration. A foundation of activity that creates attunement
between participants.

Play is "doing it for it's own sake. It doesn't have a particular
purpose" Brown says.

Vincent Baker, designer of Dogs in the Vineyard, Apocalypse World,
many others, and ton of RPG design theory says "The procedures of a
game supplant your normal interactions" and "The object of a game
supplants your normal interests" in his post Objects of RPGs. This is
completely in line with Brown's play research.

The procedures and object of a game supplant our normal interests
creating a safe environment to explore the possible

Additionally, according to Brown, "The unit of intelligibility [...]
is the story"

We play roleplaying games to explore the possibilities of
intelligibility.

As an RPG designer, this is my goal. To craft sets of procedures and
objects that supplant players normal interests with safe environments
for this exploration, and that bring the players moments of joy and
attunement.

Apocalypse World says "play to find out what happens" and I'll be
exploring this idea as well as other reasons to play in a series of
posts that I'll tag with "why we play". Look out for those if you are
interested.

Now. If you're with me, (and Vincent, and Stuart) why do you play?
What games create these safe environments for exploration?

Thanks!
