In [lasers and
feelings](http://www.onesevendesign.com/laserfeelings/), a micro RPG
by John Harper, characters get a number between 2 and 5 expressing
their position along a dichotomy from lasers (higher number) to
feelings (lower number). When doin' stuff that uses lasers (fighting,
reason, science) the d6s you roll pass when they are below the
number. When doin' stuff that uses feelings (passion, charm, empathy)
the d6s you roll succeed when they are above the number

<!--more-->

My iteration introduces multiple dichotomies. For instance a game
might have the following dichotomies. Put high numbers in each of
these to be better at the side listed first because you want to roll
below that number for a success


* Lasers and Feelings
* Near and Far

Checks would specify one side of each. Winning an argument with a
friend might be Near Feelings. Hitting someone at distance with a
Laser pistol would be Far Lasers. The first attribute of a check
determines how individual dice pass, the second attribute of a check
determines how many passed dice constitutes a failure, partial success
or full success

For every check you'll roll 6d6. If the first attribute is Feelings,
your dice pass if they are above your Lasers/Feelings number. If the
second attribute is Near, you need fewer dice to pass than your
Near/Far number

So if your Lasers/Feelings number is 4 (Better at Lasers) and your
Near/Far number is 2 (better at Far) when you roll for Far Lasers you
need to roll fewer than 4 over 2. When you roll Feelings+Near you need
to roll more than 4 under 2

Further iterations to this idea would include adding more dichotomies
and having different abilities depend on one side of two of them and
finding conditions for partial success.

I'm curious how this might work for you in real games. It feels a
little hard to get at first but could be fast once learned

Let me know how it works for you if you try it out!
