Why should players decide so much about their characters before
playing them?

Fully defining a characters starting stats and abilities before
learning who they are in relation to the other characters and the
narative reality makes sense for a game focused on strategy and
tactics when the players are familiar with the game, its systems and
the playgroup. It doesn't work so well for players new to a game,
setting, or playgroup. They may ask "Should I have high charisma? Is
that good?"

It doesn't work so well when playing to find out who we are.

## Lazy evaluation of stats

For the Cast system I'd like to constrain the design so that all
mechanical stats come from play rather than character creation. I'd
like to keep character creation and session zero 100% about
establishing the facts and details about the characters and their
relationships to each other and their world.

What game flow could make this work?

Taking inspiration from games like Fiasco, Dialect, and Microscope
start by establishing narative details about the characters and a
scene following prompts and some process. It probably doesn't need
much of a GM but how a GM might factor in is yet to be determined.

Once the fiction of the characters and a scene have been established,
jump right in! Start the scene! Each player starts with 21 experience
to spend and whenever a character does a move without an established
rank their player may opt for Retroactive Advancement

## Retroactive Advancement

Players spend Experience to initially and retroactively establish a
characher's rank in a move (Cast is Moves First so everything, even
stats and health is handeled with a move). Buying ranks come at a
quadratic cost, meaning rank 1 costs 1, rank 2 costs 2, and so
on. Buying 3 ranks would cost 6 (1+2+3) Experience. Buying 6 ranks
would cost 21 Experience. Not all advanvement is handeled
retroactively though. Characters also gain ranks in the moves they do
through the course of play.

## Active Advancement

Characters get better at what they do.

But not everything they do, just when they push themselves the right
amount. See [Getting Better at Stuff](/posts/getting-better-at-stuff/)
for the theory behind this, but the mechanic in that post is already
out of date. I'll have to write about this in the future, but the dice
mechanic will have a method of identifying when to mark Practice and
when a character has practiced enough to gain a rank.
