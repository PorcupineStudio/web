Why should players decide so much about their characters before
playing them?

Fully defining a characters starting stats and abilities before
learning who they are in relation to the other characters and the
narrative reality makes sense for a game focused on strategy and
tactics when the players are familiar with the game, its systems and
the playgroup. It doesn't work so well for players new to a game,
setting, or playgroup. They may ask "Should I have high charisma? Is
that good?"

It doesn't work so well when playing to find out who we are.

## Lazy evaluation of stats

For the Cast system I'd like to constrain the design so that all
mechanical stats come from play rather than character creation. I'd
like to keep character creation and session zero 100% about
establishing the facts and details about the characters and their
relationships to each other and their world. Remember and realize that
what makes something true in the fiction is the consent of the group.

What game flow could make this work?

Taking inspiration from games like Fiasco, Dialect, and For the Queen
start by establishing narative details about the characters and a
scene following prompts and some process. It probably doesn't need
much of a GM but how a GM might factor in is yet to be determined.

Once the fiction---and the fictional position---of the characters and
a scene have been established, jump right in! Start the scene! Each
player starts with some experience to spend and whenever a character
does a move that relies on experience expenditure rank their player
must spend unspent Experience Points (XP) to buy it. They can do that in the
moment.

## Retroactive Advancement

Players spend XP to establish a character's stats (or skills or
whatever). When you are in a situation where you want to be able to do
something, or to be able to do something better and you have the
experience to spend, you can spend it to permanently get that stat (or
skill or whatever). In order to keep people from hoarding XP the
mechanic should make it so that spending XP is more valuable. In other
words, the stats (or skills or whatever) you buy with them earns you
more XP faster than you would earn it without spending it.

## Active Advancement

Another method for stats to come from play is for characters get
better at what they do. See [Getting Better at
Stuff](/posts/getting-better-at-stuff/) for the one way to do this.
Essentially there just needs to be some way to keep track of the stats
you are using and when you earn a rank in them. It can be as simple as
"when you fail any check, mark advancement on any stats used in that
check. When you mark 4 advancement gain a rank."

## Flashbacks

Blades in the Dark by [John Harper](https://twitter.com/john_harper)
has a fantastic method of establishing a scene in progress. When you
want a bit of fictional position ("I warned her ahead of time about
this" or "I snuck in earlier to leave a weapons cache") that is
reasonable enough you go do a flashback scene to establish it. Lazy
evaluation of the scene! This makes a groups time at the table much
more efficient. They don't have to spend time thinking through and
prep for all the possible situations they might be in. The scene
will only end up being one of the infinite possibilities and so only
the plans for that one will ever be used. All prep for other
possible scenes won't come up. With flashbacks, you wait until you
know what prep you turned out to need and just go do that prep.

## What Else?

There must be more opportunities for this. I'm super interested in
finding ways to incorporate this kind of "just in time" establishment
of fiction and stats and whatever else.

Are there any more examples that y'all have? Tweet them to
me. Seriously. An thanks for reading!
