Too often we end up with surprise at the table when we were going for
suspense, why not turn to the master of suspense to see what we can
do about that?

In tabletop role playing games we can look for opportunities to let
the players in on the stakes of a situation before letting the
characters in on it. Whenever possible let the players be informed!
During a dungeon crawl, if there are traps in the hallway, tell the
players, then roll to find out if the characters notice them. If they
don't notice let them continue , players in suspense, characters
moving forward, perhaps with more caution than they otherwise would,
but worth the trade off in tension and immediacy.

In an investigation game, we can *tell the players who dun it* right
up front! Then play to find out how the characters go about solving it
for themselves. Play to find out what clues there are---which the
players themselves can now invent---what twists and turns the
investigation takes and whether they even succeed.

That sounds like a lot of fun to me.

Thanks for reading!
