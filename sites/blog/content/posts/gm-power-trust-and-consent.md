We're going to get to kink and middle management but let's start where
we usually should with the Baker Care principle. it's boss

A lot of games do what a lot of organizations do and give individual
roles specific areas of power and responsibility. Traditionally
players get power over and responsibility for narrating their
characters and the GM gets power over and responsibility for
everything else. Everyone's power is subject to the rules which are
subject to rulings by the GM.

That's quite the power differential, and that's not a bad thing. I
actually love it.

Active informed consent is critical for power differentials in social
contexts---like a game session---to be moral and rewarding for the
participants. The trust and proof of trustworthiness born from consent
given and respected is deeply satisfying and socially bonding.

How can we design games to strongly support this kind of play? Let's
look for good examples in other domains and see if we can apply them
to tabletop RPG design.

can't speak from experience) does not model
