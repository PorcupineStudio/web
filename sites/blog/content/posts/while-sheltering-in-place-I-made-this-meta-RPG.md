First, some notes.

Something amazing happens when you work on real paper. It ads the
weight of reality to what you are doing. I wrote this game in one
socially distant day on one heavy and real sheet of eleven by
seventeen

I transcribed the result below with minimal editing

If you play this please let me know how it went. Seriously let me know
at porcupine@jessebmiller.com

If you want to play this but don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about down there, please let me know and I'll explain anything.

## Meta Cast

A Meta Tabletop Role Playing Game
about making a game that is
Powered by the Apocalypse

Made during the COVID-19
Isolation period in Chicago

Written and designed by
Jesse B. Miller

edited by no one... (well me a little)

`v0.0.1-draft-probably-incoherent`

## How to play

Gather a group of 3 to 5 other players who are interested in PbtA
tabletop role playing game design (like you). I'll assume that your
group knows or can learn these concepts before you start.

> Moves, The Conversation, Fail Forward, Play to find out,
> The X Card, Lines and veils, GMless

In Meta Cast you are playing two games at once. The game you are
designing together, and meta cast. In session 0 you'll review the
above concepts with the group and create a baseline to play
from. You'l practice the Consensus Mechanism with this group by
proposing and selecting a theme, a dice mechanism, and one or two
starting moves. For anything that needs to be tracked (like health,
stats, advancement, etc.) write moves that reference and update
trackers. For example: Endure Harm might say "mark harm for your
character on a partial success. On a failure mark harm and roll
2d6. If neither of the dice are above your current harm, you die" Lazy
Evaluation (I mean Writing Moves)

Once you have a baseline jump right in and create characters with a
name and some theme appropriate descriptive characteristics. Keep
paper and pencils available for when you add moves that keep track of
stuff. You'll use the Consensus Mechanism (below) to add moves and
only moves to the game when anyone thinks someone is doing a move that
is missing.

*Only make a new move when a situation that needs it arrives.*

## The Consensus Mechanism

* Everyone individually writes down their idea, the group discusses
  them for clarity updating them until the ideas are all clear and
  concise. Only discuss for clarity, don't help write each others
  ideas.
* Everyone gets a voice token (coin, chip, or something)
  every time you run the mechanism
* Anyone who wants to vote for one of the options can vote for it AS
  MANY TIMES AS THEY CAN AFFORD. Secretly write down the option you
  are voting for and how many votes you are casting. You will stake 1
  voice token for your first vote, 2 for your second and so on. For 3
  votes you will stake 6 voice tokens (1+2+3). For 4 votes you stake
  10 (1+2+3+4) etc. You don't have to vote. You can save up tokens for
  the future if you want
* Simultaneously reveal the votes.  Keep your stake if you voted for
  the option that won. Pool the rest of the stakes and distribute them
  evenly between everyone who voted for the winning option
* If anyone has more than 50% of the tokens they lose all their
  tokens. Repeat this until no one has more than 50% of the remaining
  tokens.

## Future Work

How do we remove, replace, or update moves that are not working well?

Add some examples and suggestions

Tidy up session zero. Specify everything except the moves. The dice
mechanism, advancement, and some questions to kick start the setting

Write the "write a move" move

Thanks for reading!
