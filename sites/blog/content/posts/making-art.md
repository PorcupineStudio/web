Culture is coordinated values.
Art creates culture.
That which creates culture is art.

Tabletop play creates art to the extent that the shared fiction makes
value judgments

Lets design games for art making!

## Players as Artists

I've been listening to a lot of [Friends at the
Table](http://friendsatthetable.net/) recently and for the first
time. If you're not aware of them I'd recommend starting with [The
Road to PARTIZAN 01: Dialect
Pt. 1](http://friendsatthetable.net/the-road-to-season-6-dialect-pt-1)
or whatever the beginning of the most recent season is

**Friends at the Table is art.**

[Friends at the Table](http://friendsatthetable.net/) describe
themselves this way

> Friends at the Table is an Actual Play podcast about critical
> worldbuilding, smart characterization, and fun interaction between
> good friends.

I'm talking about the "critical" and "smart" parts. They are critical
of culture and they explore social questions intelligently. In doing
so they make cultural claims like "This is how empire requires
violence and oppression." "This is how leaders can use religion to
control culture." "This is the situation that puts actual people in."
They are doing what art does, creating and clarifying the culture of
their audience by making value judgments. They are showing us what
humanity is, who we are, and who we could be. They are making art.

How can we design games *for* this?

I'm just starting to consider it, and I bet I'll be considering it as
long as I'm designing games. As natural a place to start as any is
with Bertolt Brecht.

## Verfremdungseffekt

The distancing affect. The alienation effect.

A lot of RPG rules are reasonably criticized for being fiddly and for
taking the group out of the fiction. There is a tendency to therefor
design low profile rule sets. Don't disturb the play with rules. Don't
take players out of character. *This is not what I'm trying to do with
my designs.* It's a fine thing to do, but it's not my main goal. I'm
trying to design games that deliberately, explicitly take players out
of character and drive them towards the goals of the game. That's the
alienation effect and it's [how Apocalypse World
works](https://twitter.com/lumpleygames/status/1261009646367711232).

Brecht developed techniques to keep his audience from becoming so
emotionally attached to the characters, so invested in the story, that
they were drawn complacently in. He wanted them to maintain in
themselves a critical distance from which they would think objectively
and self-reflectively. His techniques were designed to incite
action. They were designed to show that society and culture are
constructed and that it can be changed, radically, through their
action. Brecht used these techniques to point out injustice in the
real world and motivate progress rather than offer catharsis, comfort,
or escape. Verfremdungseffekt keeps audiences from falling into
sympathies with the villainous. This theatre is called Epic theatre.

Let's make games like that!

### Breaking the 4th wall

These will be familiar because epic theatre techniques have been used
extensively in modern media. Breaking the 4th wall, speaking directly
to the camera, to the audience, reminds them that they are sitting
there watching something constructed. It breaks the simulation and
says "we are up here making art and you are there watching it. We are
telling you things. What do you think those things might be?"

Here is a nice example from the free playbooks that are now available
for [Under Hollow
Hills](https://lumpley.games/under-hollow-hills-free-downloads/) a
forthcoming game by Meguey and Vincent Baker.

This is the bulk of a move from The Lostling playbook. Thank you
Vincent for pointing me to this example, and for [talking through it
with
me](https://twitter.com/lumpleygames/status/1261009852685574150). This
article wouldn't exist without that.

> *When you see through someone*, roll. *On any hit*, call a quick

So here's a cool thing about role playing games and the 4th wall. We
are on all sides of it. It's between the hats we wear---the roles we
play. There are the characters in the fiction on one side and us
players as authors *and* us players as audience finding out what
happens on the other side. The wall can break "in reverse" and as
Vincent points out, that's what The Lostling does when they *see
through someone*. Their player breaks the wall and they watch the
players have a conversation about the character they are seeing
through. The Lostling gains insight into the player's authorial
intent! I haven't played the game yet (I don't think it's out yet),
but when this happens it must also clarify to us our intent as
authors. After that move, we all, with all our hats, "take these
insights with us" and, I imagine, some of those insights apply to our
own lives as much as our characters.

See how that crafts culture?

Are there other techniques of the Epic theatre we can use in role
playing game systems?

We could play with specific rules for a *narrator* voice (Arrested
Development?). Characters could talk to players directly or about the
dice and other cues. We could play with *rituals* like breaking into
*song* (players, characters, or both). The construction of *tableau*.
Players could play *multiple characters* with specific trade offs
between them or single characters could be played by *multiple
players*. We could write rules that *fracture the narrative*. We could
carefully construct *minimal scenes* choosing what goes into the
scenes to serve the art over realism.

Epic theatre techniques all snap the audience, out of the natural,
highly fluent, easy to process, instinctual, narrative catharsis into
an active, engaged, critical, effortful, disfluent attention. The
value and effectiveness of [processing information with difficulty
like that has been supported by
science](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0963721413498894).

Brecht had socially conscious goals and developed these techniques to
advance them. The games we design also have goals, socially conscious
or otherwise, and I'm eager to explore the application of these tools
to an Epic theatrical role play.
